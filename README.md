This repository contains project files from my Microsoft Excel Advanced course on Myskill. The project demonstrates the practical use of What-If Analysis. Key Features:

- manage multiple scenario by changing one or more input values using Scenario Manager
- identify input value to achieve the desired result using Goal Seek
- simulate multiple variables and outcomes using Data Table
- find the optimal value by changing values to achieve objectives using Solver.
